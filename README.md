## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used crime data from the Police Department of San Francisco in 2016 to know:

1. What is the most frequent type of crime?
2. What is the safest neighborhood in San Francisco? And the least safe?
2. How are all these crimes resolved?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupyter notebook with all the code used to answer to the three questions above: SFOcrime.ipynb.

Also, there is a MIT license explaining the limits of usability of the provided code.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main results obtained with the data and the answered questions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@albertoserrano/three-insights-from-san-franciscos-crime-to-make-it-a-safer-city-a6e7be5fc4c8).

In the post, it is described how the most common crime in San Francisco is pickpocketing and shoplifting, focused on the most touristic areas of the city. A main conclusion that can be also drawn is that most of the offences remain unresolved.

The dataset used for analysing the crime in San Francisco can be found in Kaggle, in the following link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset).

Also, must give credit to the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree and all the resources they have provided me with.
